- Exes and Ohs

Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

Examples input/output:

```
XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false
```
- ten minute walk

a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk 1 block which takes 1 minute to traverse. 
Creating a function that returns a true when the input array is 10 minutes long and lands at the same destination as they started. 

- Your order please 

Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.

Examples

```
"is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
"4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
""  -->  ""
```

- Supermarket Queue

Write a function to calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!

##input
customers: an array of positive integers representing the queue. Each integer represents a customer, and its value is the amount of time they require to check out.
n: a positive integer, the number of checkout tills.

##output
The function should return an integer, the total time required.

- Sum of two

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

input's and outputs
get_sum(1, 0) == 1   # 1 + 0 = 1
get_sum(1, 2) == 3   # 1 + 2 = 3
get_sum(0, 1) == 1   # 0 + 1 = 1
get_sum(1, 1) == 1   # 1 Since both are same
get_sum(-1, 0) == -1 # -1 + 0 = -1
get_sum(-1, 2) == 2  # -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2

## Javascripts: 

##Vowel Count

This code war was done in javascript :) 

input : a given string is inputted as a parameter 
output : we need to count the number of vowels present in the string

edge case: string will consist of lower case letters and/or spaces. 

##Find the Odd int 

Given an array, find the int that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
